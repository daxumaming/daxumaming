## Hi there üëã

With extensive experience in web and application development, I have a robust skill set in software development for the web and desktop applications. My expertise extends to API and mobile application development, having created REST API servers and Android applications. I am also proficient in Linux server management having transitioned numerous servers from Windows to Ubuntu & Oracle Enterprise Linux. My experience also covers various RDBMS databases such as MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and Oracle 12c/19c databases.
